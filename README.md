## 📬 Contact Modal

Each drink card has a **Contact** button that opens a modal with a form containing:
- Name
- Email
- Message
- Send/Close buttons

⚠️ *Note: The form does not submit data — it’s for UI demonstration only.*

## 📌 Customization

- Add more drinks by duplicating a `.drink` card block.
- Connect the form to a backend (e.g., Firebase, Node.js, or Formspree) to enable submissions.
- Update branding, colors, or text as needed for your brand.
